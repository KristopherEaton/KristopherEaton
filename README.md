### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a Front-End Developer <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30"> from Goodyear, AZ.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently employed as a developer full-time learning to build applications in REACT and am amazed at fast something can be created with this Framework! 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently still learning the mysteries of Angular and have over a year of experience with Angular 8. I hope to work more with Angular in the future along with implementing cloud storage solutions such as those offered by Firebase and AWS.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything web related really. I have a strong background in good 'ol WordPress and am looking to expand my skillset a bit. While I still enjoy building solid websites for small business owners, the creativity allowed with Frameworks such as React or Angular are what interest me.
